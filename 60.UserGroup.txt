When ever a new User is register in Project, Each new User should be assign to some Group.
And that Group is already available which is created by Admin.

1. Log as admin,
2. GoTo Groups,
3. Add Group,
4. Type Author and Choose permissions,
5. Save

You can create more than on group:
Create Author and Admin group
So, when ever a new user gets register we have to assign them within created Group.



i.e 
In view.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group
In signup method
role_group = Group.objects.get(name="Author") #instance of group named as Author
user.groups.add(role_group) # assign new registered user into Author group






Note only staff can log in into admin pannel
