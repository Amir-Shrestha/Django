Each models in django maps to a single database table. <==> means <==> a model makes/have its own single table in database in django.
Each app in django have a model.py file by default at a time we create app.
As data get store in database, In django by default data gets store in sqlite.
You can see db.sqlite3 in Mac_project_folder

If we go inside our setting.py in our Mac_project_app we can see that we have db.sqlite3 as our default database.
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}

Extra :
{
'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3', this means that it has join 'db.sqlite3' to our base directory of our os path.
SQLite is a relational database management system (RDBMS software) contained in a C library.
}
Therefore Django stores data in sqlite database.




Now, Apps that we have over here.(see inside setting.py) will use/have a table in database overhere as every app have to store their data somewhere.
For example : admin, shop, blog are some of apps in our Mac project.
So all these apps uses table in our database.
Therefore we have to make tables for all app.

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'blog',
    'shop'
]







As before we used to see error in our terminal that : 
error : you have 15 unapplied migrations and your project may not work properly

This error appears/means that we have not made tables that we need for our this project/project_apps

so we need to issue command to make table
cmd : python manage.py make migrate
We are commanding dajngo to make all the required tables for our project and keep it in sqlite
Here python manage.py make migrate will apply all the migration that were needed.
But before applying migrate we need to make migration
But why we have not make any migration over here before doing migrate.

Migration means we are storing/saving information of those changes that we have made in our model.
So after we change model we make migration that save information of change made in model but not link with database.
And when we migrate which will make change in database too, i.e : cmd : python manage.py migrate
Till now we have just applyed migrate but not make migration.

But we can also make our own migration in our shop/migration directory.

But before applying migrate we need to make migration
But why we have not make any migration over here before doing migrate.








Ok to see this come into model.py of our shop app,

Create table : 

   from django.db import models

   class Product(models.Model):
      product_id = models.AutoField
      product_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      desciption = models.CharField(max_length=300)
      publish_date = models.DateField()

Module : django.db.models
Table_name : Product 
Column_name : product_id, product_name, desciption , publish_date.
Field_Reference : AutoField, CharField, DateField.





Now go to the shop/apps.py we have class called ShopConfig. This file is create at the time we make this app using cmd : python manage.py startapp

class ShopConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'shop'

This file is create at the time we make this app using cmd : python manage.py startapp

Before in INSTALLED_APPS  we add shop and blog app just to make use of it but in real we dont do that we actually should add apps as shop.apps.ShopConfig.
So, we need to replace shop by shop.apps.ShopConfig in our INSTALLED_APPS 

Therefore:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'blog',
    'shop'
]

to

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'shop.apps.ShopConfig', #here*********************************************
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'blog' #yet to come as we are working in shop app at the moment
]


Now test this by restarting server.
cmd : python manage.py runserver



Now as we said before : 
migration means we are storing/saving information of those changes that we have made in our model.
Here model doesnt means to model.py file instead model refer to class name that create table i.e (class Product)
Here as we have made change in shop/models.py over (class Product). 

So now make our own migration ==> cmd : python manage.py makemigrations
This will make/create migration(info) in our shop/migration directory.

i.e :

C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\MyAwesomeCart\Mac>python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'shop':
  shop\migrations\0001_initial.py
    - Create model Product


Now you can see migration_info inside shop/migrations  named as : 0001_initial.py
See it !
Till here we have not write/saved it in database we have just saved information of change made in model(class Product).


Now, we need to apply migration that we have saved/stored in our app.
cmd : python manage.py migrate


i.e :
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\MyAwesomeCart\Mac>python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, shop
Running migrations:
  Applying shop.0001_initial... OK

Therefore we have write/created table in our sqlite database. But how can we see it ?
Answer : We can see it using/creating admin account.
By default django provide us perfect admin pannel for super_user.
We just need to write command to use it.
We can do add, remove etc operation in our tables.
