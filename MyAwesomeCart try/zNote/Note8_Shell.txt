So do we always insert product using admin pannel only?
No we do have django python manage.py shell to perform various texting(inserttion,selection etc) using terminal.



Here now inroduce yourself with 
cmd : python manage.py shell


Extra about power shell
{
mouse right click point to the start menu and click to Window Powershell(admin)

1. powershell : cd ~ ==> take you to home_directory/base_directory ==> (cd till)
PS C:\Windows\system32> cd ~

2. powershell : cd py press tab ==> gives ==> cd .\PycharmProjects\
PS C:\Users\SimbA> cd .\PycharmProjects\
PS C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects>

You can even do this in your pycharm terminal !



Here,  Now you are in :
PS C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects>
}

Simply in state terminal at you Project_Folder_Dir where there is manage.py
i.e :
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\MyAwesomeCart\Mac>

Then,
cmd : python manage.py shell

Now see that your shell is opened now :
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\MyAwesomeCart\Mac>python manage.py shell
Python 3.9.4 (tags/v3.9.4:1f2e308, Apr  6 2021, 13:40:21) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)]
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.23.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.


So why are we doing this all? Why shell ?
Because we use it for testing model etc on the fly in shell.
i.e we can run django code in terminal for testing pur[ose.

Now once shell is opened
write django code in it :

1. from shop.models import Product

2. Product.objects.all()
Out[2]: <QuerySet [<Product: Kulekhani>, <Product: Doko>, <Product: Kucho>]>
You can see sets of all object(record) in your product table

3.product3 = Product(product_name="mouse", category="computer", sub_category="device", price=250, desciption="Dell is234", publish_date=timezone.now()))
here we are making new object/record as product3 for Product table by this above django statement as product_name, category, sub_category, price, desciption, publish_date are 
the feild/column/attributes of table/Product_model an we are passing values to all attributes.
here we are not passing product_id as it is auto_increament and leveing image attribute as default value.
When you write above_django_statement you will get error as NameError: name 'timezone' is not defined.
Because we dont have any function call timezome so we have to import this timezone function from django.utils module.

4. from django.utils import timezone

Again code above_django_statement:
5. Product(product_name="mouse", category="computer", sub_category="device", price=250, desciption="Dell is234", publish_date=timezone.now()))
Now you have create new object product3 but not saved in database see in Products table in admin pannel there is no any product called as Mouse.

So save it.
6.product3.save()
And agian see in Products table in admin pannel there product called as Mouse.


Now try to domain/values of object/record you just created :

8.  product3.product_id
Out[10]: django.db.models.fields.AutoField

9.  product3.product_name
Out[11]: 'Mouse'


Finally new product(Mouse) has been added into our database:
See it by :
10. Product.objects.all()
Out[12]: <QuerySet [<Product: Kulekhani>, <Product: Doko>, <Product: Kucho>, <Product: Mouse>]>


In this way we can do object insertion in our database regardless of admin pannel.

Select specific object from table :

11. Product.objects.get(product_name="Mouse")
Out[14]: <Product: Mouse>


12. a=Product.objects.get(product_name="Mouse")
13. a.category
Out[16]: 'computer'



In this way we can do query to our database using shell from terminal regardless of admin pannel.
We can do our test of python code over terminal using shell.
