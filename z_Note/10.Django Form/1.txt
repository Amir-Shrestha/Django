from django import forms #here forms is module and ModelForm, Form are classes


class SubscribeForm(forms.Form): #Form_API
	Email = forms.EmailField()

class CommentForm(forms.ModelForm): #ModelForm
	class Meta:
		model = Comment
		fields = ('name', 'email', 'comment_body')

classes in model.py is responsible to create database_table,
whereas classes in form.py is responsible to create template_form

when we render object of classes in form.py to template.html from views.py, html code is generated in html_template,
i.e :
{{ form_obj.as_p }}
