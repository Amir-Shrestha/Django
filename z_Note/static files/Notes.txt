# 3
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static_assets')   (userdefine)
static_assets : folder where dajngo will stored all collected static files in root directory for deployment.

# 4

{% load static %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'core/css/core.css' %}" /> 

Question : 
In setting.py STATIC_URL refers to STATIC_ROOT(static folder in root of project) folder.
But
How does STATIC_URL refers to the app_static_folder with randome name given to this folder?
This is because we should always give app static folder name as static. always clear browser history and runserver again when change made in static files.

If you you pust folder name static first and change it later but also it works untill you clear browser history and runserver agaia.

if delpoy static files in cloud cervices
STATIC_ROOT = "/var/www/example.com/static" (host)

if delpoy static files in local server
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static_assets')


Note:
Static files are part of your application code, while media is for generated content by your application or users of your application.
