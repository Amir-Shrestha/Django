Just what we did in shell practise is goona repeat over here.


So what we are gonna do is that we will render to template files with template/content data as params_dictionary(params = {}).
Here, params_dictionary consist of content_data_of_template_files.
Now we need to pass some parameters in params_dictionary(params = {}) which gets render to template(shop/index.html). i.e return render(request, 'shop/index.html', params)
So what parameter does params_dictionary contains?
params = {}

Here, params_dictionary contains QuerySet, No_of_Slides, range_function

1.
QuerySet :
QuerySet (object/record of all products) , QuerySet ==> A QuerySet represents a collection/list of objects from your database. 
#fetch all product object from database and pass them as parameter into templates
def index(request):
    all_products= Product.objects.all() #fetch all product object from database #all_products = QuerySet
    print(all_products) #this gets print/fetch in terminal not in browerser/template
i.e : 
    params = {'product':all_products}

#EXtra :
{
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
<QuerySet [<Product: Kulekhani>, <Product: Doko>, <Product: Kucho>, <Product: Mouse>]>
[05/May/2021 18:16:05] "GET /shop/ HTTP/1.1" 200 12770
}

Note : You should imort Product class In shop/views.py from shop/models.py before setting QuerySet.
#import Product class from model.py
from .models import Product 







2.
No_of_Slides :
No_of_Slides = n//4 + ceil (n/4 - n//4) # see in Note10_Logic_Formula_To_Show_Posts

Here, n is total_number_of_post/object/record in database.
And here all_products is a QuerySet that holds all_post/object/record/table_row.
Which means,
total_number_of_post/object/record = n = len(all_products)


Note : Inorder to use ceil() function we need to import ceil() function from math module
i.e :
#import math
from math import ceil

So params,
params = {'product':all_products, 'total_slides':No_of_Slides, }








3.
range_function :
range(No_of_Slides)

So params,
params = {'product':all_products, 'total_slides':No_of_Slides, 'range':range(1,No_of_Slides) }
Here we start range of slide from 1 because our first active slide will be fixed something like that.

Finally,now all these parameters are avialable in template_file(shop/index.html) as passed them through params.



from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Product
from math import ceil

# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    all_products = Product.objects.all()
    print(all_products)
    n = len(all_products)
    No_of_Slides = n // 4 + ceil(n / 4 - n // 4)
    params = {'product':all_products, 'total_slides':No_of_Slides, 'range':range(1,No_of_Slides) }
    return render(request, 'shop/index.html',params)






Now Work for views.py is done now got to index.py.
