Therefore we have write/created table in our sqlite database. But how can we see it ?
Answer : We can see it using/creating admin account.
By default django provide us perfect admin pannel for super_user.
We just need to write command to use it.
We can do add, remove etc operation in our tables.

when you go to url : http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
Page appears asking Username and Password.
So creating super admin account.

In terminal :
cmd : python manage.py createsuperuser
give name, email, password.
Note password doesnt appear in screen when we create it : helloworld

Runserver
got to admin page
login


Now inside admin page we cannot see the Product table that we created in model.
We can just see Groups, Users.

So inorder to see our product table in admin pannel we need to register it.
Therefore, Every table/model_class that we create inside our model.py we need to register our table in admin.py
 


As we are working in shop app at the moment we need to go inside shop/admin.py of our shop app.
import the Product class in admin.py from models.py
from .models import Product



now register Product table:
admin.site.register(Product)

also import admin model


i.e in shop/admin.py

from django.contrib import admin
# Register your models here.
from .models import Product
admin.site.register(Product)

Now refresh Admin pannel, you can see Products table in Shop app
Now add product and save it.
You can see product object getting added.


Now design home page : index.py of Shop app
