Now go to Admin_page/Product_Table and Edit products and save.
Now see in Shop app images folder is created automatically when we add image from admin page and image is inside image folder.

But this is not recomended way to upload files in django. 
So will do it in recomended way.
So we will learn how to define media_directory and media_url and push all media in that folder.

First Go to Mac/setting.py
and add some media files :

#managing media files OR  add some media files
import os
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')  #define media_directory 
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'  # define media_url_route


Now go to Mac/urls.py and edit url pattern.
But at first I edit url pattern of shop.urls but also it was working.Why?
Inorder to edit import two module_funtion

In shop/urls not needed...........................
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

And  ==> + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
with our urlpattern
i.e:

from django.urls import path
from . import views
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='shopindex'),
    path('about', views.about_us, name='about_us'),
    path('contact', views.contact_us, name='contact_us'),
    path('tracker', views.tracker_status, name='tracker_status'),
    path('product', views.product_view, name='product_view'),
    path('checkout', views.check_out, name='check_out'),
    path('search', views.search, name='search'),
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT) #it works but only for shop app. We need media dir for other apps also so below:

In Mac/urls :
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('shop/', include('shop.urls')),
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)






Here till now before this media method our files/image was saved in shop/images
but after this media setting when we save our image it gets saved in media/shop/images folder as this folder directory gets created automatically by django after media setting.
as in model.py inside Product class we have :
image = models.ImageField(upload_to="shop/images", default="")
upload_to="shop/images"

So,shop/images inside media directory.
i.e :
images get saved in media/shop/images folder

So why media directory?
because in setting.py :
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
# BASE_DIR, 'media'

Upload image in media root /shop/images

Now finally go to admin pannel and add images

See media/shop/images directory is created in Mac root project folder.


Ok now runserver you can see 4.media url endpoint get added.
i.e

Using the URLconf defined in Mac.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

admin/
shop/
blog/
^media/(?P<path>.*)$
The empty path didnâ€™t match any of these.





Here, place where images are store see the difference :
shop/images  ==> we save image over here manually
shop/static/shop ==> static_directory(save/upload image/file from admin pannel )
media/shop/images  ==> recommended way to save/upload image/file from admin pannel defining media derectory




Now till now we have upgrade url pattern so that file of the each shop_post can be save in remcommended media_directory.
But still you can see the image from static file in you shop index page/template.
So how can we display images uploaded for respective shop_post into our shop index page/template from our remcommended media_directory.
