No_of_Slides = n//4 + ceil (n/4 - n//4)
No_of_Slides is the Total carsoul_slides.

For example in our template one Carsousal_slide contains 4_post/object/record.
So if there are toatal of 47_post/object/record uploaded in our database then it will have total of 47/4=11.75 slides
As one slide=4_posts, 11*4=44 post and remainning 3 in another slide.
Therefore 11 slide with 4_posts and last_1_slide with 3 post.
Total of 12 slides.

Note that is total number of post/object/record is divisible by 4 then No_of_Slides = Total_post/4 or Total_post//4
But if total number of post/object/record is not divisible by 4 then No_of_Slides = Total_post//4 + 1
Here plus 1 slide for remaining posts.

So coming to formula/logic.
# Logic 1
No_of_Slides = n//4 + ceil (n/4 - n//4)
Here, n is total_number_of_post/object/record in database

# Extra Logic 2
if n<4 then, No_of_Slides = 1
elseif n%4==0 then, No_of_Slides = n/4
else No_of_Slides = n/4 + 1



47/4 = 11.75
47//4 = 11
11.75 - 11 = 0.75
ceil(0.75) = 1

No_of_Slides = n//4 + ceil (n/4 - n//4)
Here, ceil (n/4 - n//4) will give 1/0 only

if total number of post/object/record is divisible by 4, then ceil(n/4-n//4)=0
if total number of post/object/record is not divisible by 4,  then ceil(n/4-n//4)=1
